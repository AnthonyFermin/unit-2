### Open Source

#### Instructions

This is an individual assignment.

The purpose of this assignment is to further deal with collaboration on bigger projects.

#### Requirements

##### Part I

* Open at least three issues against the repo that you worked with this past week. These can be anything from
[bug fixes](https://github.com/forkhubs/android/issues/560) to [feature requests](https://github.com/forkhubs/android/issues/559), but do not open issues that have already been opened.
* Open at least one issue against the repo that you worked with in Week 1. Make sure to look at the other issues
that have been open. Do not duplicate issues.
* With your team from week 0, review all pull requests and respond to all issues on your group project repo. Responses could be about [project scope](https://github.com/forkhubs/android/issues/766), or simply discussion on how the [issue fits in with the app](https://github.com/forkhubs/android/issues/677). The point is to address the concern raised in the issue. Not everyone has to respond to everything - divide up the work amongst yourselves. You do not have to merge anything or implement anything new.

##### Part II

Take a look at the issues for [The Github Android App](https://github.com/forkhubs/android/issues?page=2&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).
Choose an issue to tackle. Open that issue against [the Access Code fork of this project](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/android).
Do not open a new issue if your issue is already there.

Write some code to fix the issue. Create a PR against the Access Code fork of this project.

##### Bonus

Contribute to an open source Java or Android project. If you do this, please send us a link to the PR.

If you want to contribute to any of these, let us know! They're excited to help AccessCoders get their PRs through:
* [Alessandro's repos](https://github.com/sephiroth74?tab=repositories)
* Some repos managed by Ben Romano: [CacheManager](https://github.com/BrandonRomano/CacheManager),
[Android Typeface Views](https://github.com/carrot/android-typeface-views),
[Recycler Core](https://github.com/carrot/recycler-core), [Shortcake](https://github.com/carrot/Shortcake),
[Cream](https://github.com/carrot/cream), [Swap](https://github.com/carrot/swap),
[Unitizer](https://github.com/carrot/unitizer)

Here are a few others you can look at:
* Github's Android App
* [Jake Wharton's Repos](https://github.com/JakeWharton?tab=repositories)
* [The Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/source/contributing.html)
* [Github's List of Android Projects Sorted by # of Forks](https://github.com/search?o=desc&p=1&q=android&s=forks&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93)

#### Tips

* Branch names should be descriptive.
* Pull requests should be [descriptive](https://github.com/forkhubs/android/pull/756).
* Discussion is healthy!
* Open source projects are communities as much as software.
