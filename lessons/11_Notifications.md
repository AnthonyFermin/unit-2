## Notifications

### Objective

Students will become familiar with the Android notification system and practice implementing their own complex
notifications.

### Do Now (Morning)

Create a timer app. The app should take in some number of seconds before a "reminder" comes up. Use `handler.PostDelayed` and open a new activity (can just be an activity that displays "New Activity") when the countdown has finished.

### Lesson (Morning)

#### Notifications in Android

Notifications are tricky because they are displayed outside of your application. Then notification drawer and notifications are controlled by the Android system.

To trigger a notification, call `.notify()` with a `Notification` object on the `NotificationManager` object.

#### Notification Builder

In order to create a `Notification` object, use the [`NotificationCompat.Builder`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/NotificationCompat.Builder.html). The notification information can be set up on the `Builder` object, and then the notification can be created by calling `.build()`. The Builder pattern is a common Android pattern, so that you create immutable objects.

A Notification must include `setSmallIcon()`, `setContentTitle()` and `setContentText()`.

### Exercises (Morning)

Using the app from the Do Now, have the application issue a notification when it's time for the reminder.

### Do Now (Afternoon)

Modify your Do Now app so that when the user clicks on the notification, it opens up the new activity.

### Lesson (Afternoon)

#### Actions

A notification can trigger a variety of different actions. To set the Activity that is opened, create a `PendingIntent` object. This object can then be passed to the `NotificationCompat.Builder` object with several different methods. Use the `setContentIntent()` method to set the Activity that gets called when the user clicks on the notification.

##### PendingIntent

The `PendingIntent` object can be created using `PendingIntent.getActivity()`, `PendingIntent.getActivities()`, `PendingIntent.getBroadcast()` or `PendingIntent.getService()`. These methods take in an Intent object and Application Context.

#### Lock Screen

Notifications can be displayed on the lock screen. Using `setVisibility()` you can display the full notification on the lock screen using `VISIBILITY_PUBLIC`, not show the notification on the lock screen using `VISIBILITY_SECRET` and only show limited information using `VISIBILITY_PRIVATE`. If using a private notifcation, you can set up the lock screen version using `setPublicVersion()`.

#### Updating and Removing

If a notification may need to be updated, use a notification ID when calling `.notify()`. You can then use this notification ID to call `.notify()` with the notification ID and the new Notification object. You can also use this notification ID to `cancel()` the notification.

#### Expanded Notifications

Notifications can be expanded to a larger view so that you can see more detailed info in the notification drawer. In order to expand notifications, you can use `NotificationCompat.Builder.setStyle()`, which takes in a layout that can be displayed in the expanded view.

#### User Experience

Notifcations have strict design guidelines since they appear outside the application. When creating notifications, be sure to look at the [notifications design guide](http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/notifications.html). Some other things to keep in mind is that users may turn off notifications or even uninstall an app; be mindful of how you use notifications in your app.
